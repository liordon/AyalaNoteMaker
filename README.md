# AyalaNoteMaker
Makes notes for a social matching game.

## How to play the game
To prepare the game, the instructors should collect as much data as possible about all the participants. This can be done via google forms, for example.
They then decide on predicates to this data that indicate subgroups of participants.

When the game starts each participant is given a note with colorful symbols/emojis.
The goal of the participants will be to find out what each symbol indicates (what's in common between all participants having this symbol).
